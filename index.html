                        Success has always had myriad connotations for every individual. 
                        For some it is recognition in society, and for some, success is about evolution. 
                        E - Cell, through its activities and competitions, has achieved both. 16 years of unprecedented work and planning has led to E-Cell being recognized as the Leading Entrepreneurship Promoting Student Organization in the country by the ‘NEN Achievement Awards’ instituted by the Wadhwani Foundation and felicitated at TiECon 2005. 
                        One among the various milestones achieved in its quest for perfection was the success in making ‘Eureka!', E-cell's B-Plan competition, Asia's largest in 2001. 
                        CNN as well as Thomson Reuters have now recognized ‘Eureka!’ as Asia's largest Business Model competition.

                        Success, for us, is not only about the milestones we reach but is also about the number of lives we affect during our journey.
                        With this in mind, we helped in the establishment of 150+ E-Cells in about 80 cities across the nation, through our initiative, National Entrepreneurship Challenge. 
                        The Entrepreneurship Summit is our annual flagship event, which has received patronage from UNESCO, Make in india, Digital India and Startup India. 
                        It brings together the leading entrepreneurs of the world and caters to all those crazy rebels who wish to change the world, start their own business or fund a business and become a trend-setter. 
                        Eminent personalities like Mr. Travis Kalanick (Founder & CEO, Uber), Sachin Bansal( Co-founder & Executive chairman, Flipkart) Mr. Nandan Nilekani (Co-founder, Infosys), Dr. Werner Vogels, (CTO, Amazon.com) have been a part of the Summit.
